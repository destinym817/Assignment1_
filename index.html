			<p> 	Giulian Drimbaâ€™s website, doublepi.me, is very interesting to me because of how interactive it is. The site is his online portfolio of his animations. His animations are continuously running in the background depending on which page the viewer is on. For some of the pages of his website his animations follows the mouse of his viewer. That is really interesting to me. I also like the simplicity of the rest of his site, which is great especially because his animations make his backgrounds really busy. </p>

			<h2><a href="http://neilcarpenter.com/">Neil Carpenter</a></h2> 
			<p> 	Neil Carpenter's website interests me because of how creative his main page is. 
			The main page of his website has different shpes falling diagnally across the screen. 
			In the bottom right corner, there is text that keeps moving describing what he does. Carpenter 
			put statements such as "i write Javascript" and "I build Webbapps" while also joking around and saying 
			"I drink coffee." I just like the movement of his main page, it really caugh my attention. </p>
