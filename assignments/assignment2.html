			<p> 	Neil Carpenter's website interests me because of how creative his main page is. The main page of his website has different shpes falling diagnally across the screen. In the bottom right corner, there is text that keeps moving describing what he does. Carpenter put statements such as "i write Javascript" and "I build Webbapps" while also joking around and saying "I drink coffee." I just like the movement of his main page, it really caugh my attention. </p>
