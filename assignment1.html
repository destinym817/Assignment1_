			<p> 	Giulian Drimbaâ€™s website, doublepi.me, is very interesting to me because of 
			how interactive it is. The site is his online portfolio of his animations. His animations
			are continuously running in the background depending on which page the viewer is on. For some
			of the pages of his website his animations follows the mouse of his viewer. That is really 
			interesting to me. I also like the simplicity of the rest of his site, which is great especially 
			because his animations make his backgrounds really busy. </p>
